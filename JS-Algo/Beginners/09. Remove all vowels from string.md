Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.

For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".

Note: for this kata y isn't considered a vowel.
```

```js
function disemvowel(str) {
  return str.replace(/[aeiou]/gi, '');
}
```
